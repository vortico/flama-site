## A minimalistic example: Hello 🔥 API

The best way to start getting familiarised with <FlamaName /> is by example. Let's start coding the simplest
application:

```python
from flama import Flama

app = Flama()

@app.route("/")
def home():
    return {"message": "Hello 🔥"}
```

The code does the following:

- Imports <FlamaName /> and creates the instance `app` of this class.
- Adds the `route()` decorator to the user-defined function `home`. This decorator specifies that the function `home`
  will be called when a request to the route `/` is made. This will return the dictionary `{"message": "Hello 🔥"}`.

You can download this code in your **examples** folder by running:

```console
cd examples
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vortico/flama/master/examples/hello_flama.py
```

## Running your App

To run your first <FlamaName /> application:

```console
flama run examples.hello_flama:app

INFO:     Started server process [78260]
INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
INFO:     Application startup complete.
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

This command runs the [uvicorn](https://www.uvicorn.org/) web server. If you click now on **http://127.0.0.1:8000**, you
should see the greeting message `{"message": "Hello 🔥"}` on your browser.

### Alternative running

The previous code can be tuned a bit so that you can run it the same way from your favourite programming IDE:

```python
import flama

app = Flama()

@app.route("/")
def home():
    return {"message": "Hello 🔥"}

if __name__ == "__main__":
    flama.run(flama_app=app, server_host="0.0.0.0", server_port=8080)
```

You can now run the code directly from your IDE, either by clicking on the run button, or by any other key shortcut you
prefer, and you will obtain the same result. As of now, we will always include this small modification in our examples,
but will always use <FlamaName /> CLI to run the examples to showcase the conveniences it brings.

### What if the server does not start?

There are several reasons why the server might not start after running `flama run`.

If there is another service already using the port **8000** you will see an error like:

```console
flama run examples.hello_flama:app

INFO:     Started server process [54203]
INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
INFO:     Application startup complete.
ERROR:    [Errno 48] error while attempting to bind on address ('127.0.0.1', 8000):
          address already in use
INFO:     Waiting for application shutdown.
INFO:     Application shutdown complete.
```

If you get an error similar to:

```console
flama run examples.hello_flama:app

command not found: flama
```

this means the virtual environment where <FlamaName /> was installed is not active. Activate the virtual environment
(see [installation](/docs/getting-started/installation/)) and try again.

Another possibility is that the application path (i.e. **examples.hello_flama:app**) is wrong. This is the case when you
have an error like:

```console
flama run hello_flama:app

ERROR:    Error loading ASGI app. Could not import module "hello_flama".
```

The only way of fixing this is by providing the correct application path. In this example, the path must be
**examples.hello_flama:app** given that we are running <FlamaName /> CLI at the same level as the folder **examples**:

```console
examples/
└── hello_flama.py
    └── app
```

## Autogenerated API docs

Don't you miss anything in our previous code? Sure, docstrings! We know, they are very important. Let's add it:

```python
import flama

app = flama.Flama(
    title="Hello-🔥",
    version="1.0",
    description="My first API",
)

@app.route("/")
def home():
    """
    tags:
        - Salute
    summary:
        Returns a warming message.
    description:
        This is a more detailed description of the method itself.
        Here we can give all the details required and they will appear
        automatically in the auto-generated docs.
    responses:
        200:
            description: Warming hello message.
    """
    return {"message": "Hello 🔥"}

if __name__ == "__main__":
    flama.run(flama_app=app, server_host="0.0.0.0", server_port=8080)
```

We can proceed, and run:

```console
flama run examples.hello_flama:app

INFO:     Started server process [3267]
INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
INFO:     Application startup complete.
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

This time, let's visit **http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs/** and see what's there waiting for us.

Yup, <FlamaName /> automatically generates the API schema following the OpenAPI standard, and provides a convenient
interface to interact with the documentation.

To deep dive into the <FlamaName/> CLI, please go to the [Flama CLI section](/docs/flama-cli/run/). If you are more
