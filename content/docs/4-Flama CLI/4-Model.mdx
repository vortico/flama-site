## Serverless interaction

We've discussed how to serve models as APIs with which we can interact
with via HTTP requests. However, it might be the case that we want to interact with
the model directly without the overhead of a server, e.g.:

- **Development & testing**: We are working with a model locally and want to try it out on some data to
  quickly see whether everything is working as expected. This is typically what happens
  when we're in the development stage of the ML lifecycle.

- **Streaming workflow**: This is also the case when we want to use a model as part of a larger pipeline
  where the model acts as a data processor in a stream of data, in which case we want to be able to pipe data
  into the model and get the output back.

It is then clear that we need a different way to make use of the model than the
client-server approach we've discussed so far.

The command **model** allows us to interact with models directly from the command line
without the need for a server. To inspect the command options, run:

```console
flama model --help

Usage: flama model [OPTIONS] MODEL_PATH COMMAND [ARGS]...

  Interact with an ML model without server.

  This command is used to directly interact with an ML model without the need
  of a server. This command can be used to perform any operation that is
  supported by the model, such as inspect, or predict. <FLAMA_MODEL_PATH> is
  the path of the model to be used, e.g. 'path/to/model.flm'. This can be
  passed directly as argument of the command line, or by environment variable.

Options:
  --help  Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  inspect  Inspect an ML model.
  predict  Make a prediction using an ML model.
```

### Inspect

The sub-command **inspect** allows us to get access to the model metadata,
as well as the list of artifacts packaged with the model, in a human-readable
format. To access the documentation of the command, run:

```console
flama model path/to/model.flm inspect --help

Usage: flama model FLAMA_MODEL_PATH inspect [OPTIONS]

  Inspect an ML model.

  This command is used to inspect an ML model without the need of a server.
  This command can be used to extract the ML model metadata, including the ID,
  time when the model was created, information of the framework, and the model
  info; and the list of artifacts packaged with the model.

Options:
  -p, --pretty  Pretty print the model inspection.
  --help        Show this message and exit.
```

### Predict

The sub-command **predict** allows us to make predictions using the model. To access
the documentation of the command, run:

```console
flama model path/to/model.flm predict --help

Usage: flama model FLAMA_MODEL_PATH predict [OPTIONS]

  Make a prediction using an ML model.

  This command is used to make a prediction using an ML model without the need
  of a server. It can be used for batch predictions, so both input and output
  arguments must be json files containing a list of input values, each input
  value being a list of values associated to the input of the model. The
  output will be the list of predictions associated to the input, with each
  prediction being a list of values representing the output of the model.

  Example:

  - input.json: [[0, 0], [0, 1], [1, 0], [1, 1]]

  - output.json: [[0], [1], [1], [0]]

Options:
  -f, --file FILENAME    File to be used as input for the model prediction in
                         JSON format. (default: stdin).
  -o, --output FILENAME  File to be used as output for the model prediction in
                         JSON format. (default: stdout).
  -p, --pretty           Pretty print the model prediction.
  --help                 Show this message and exit.
```

## Examples

To illustrate the usage of the **model** command, we'll use one of the models introduced
before in the [Serve](/docs/flama-cli/serve/#example-files) section, e.g. the **SciKit-Learn** model.

### Model inspection

To start with, let's inspect the model:

```console
flama model sklearn_model.flm inspect

{"meta": {"id": "43dcc9bb-528f-47e7-b68b-a8b9aa6ffd22", "timestamp": "2025-04-03T19:47:56.590410", "framework": {"lib": "sklearn", "version": "1.5.2"}, "model": {"obj": "MLPClassifier", "info": {"activation": "tanh", "alpha": 0.0001, "batch_size": "auto", "beta_1": 0.9, "beta_2": 0.999, "early_stopping": false, "epsilon": 1e-08, "hidden_layer_sizes": [10], "learning_rate": "constant", "learning_rate_init": 0.001, "max_fun": 15000, "max_iter": 2000, "momentum": 0.9, "n_iter_no_change": 10, "nesterovs_momentum": true, "power_t": 0.5, "random_state": null, "shuffle": true, "solver": "adam", "tol": 0.0001, "validation_fraction": 0.1, "verbose": false, "warm_start": false}, "params": {"solver": "adam"}, "metrics": {"recall": "0.95"}}, "extra": {"model_version": "1.0.0", "model_description": "This is a test model", "model_author": "John Doe", "model_license": "MIT", "tags": ["test", "example"]}}, "artifacts": {"foo.json": "/var/folders/h4/vc_99fk53b93ttsv18ss8vhw0000gn/T/tmppzdv2rur/artifacts/foo.json"}}
```

As we can see, the model metadata is returned in JSON format. If we want to get a more
human-readable output, we can use the **--pretty** option:

```console
flama model sklearn_model.flm inspect --pretty

{
    "artifacts": {
        "foo.json": "/var/folders/h4/vc_99fk53b93ttsv18ss8vhw0000gn/T/tmpcnw6yms0/artifacts/foo.json"
    },
    "meta": {
        "extra": {
            "model_author": "John Doe",
            "model_description": "This is a test model",
            "model_license": "MIT",
            "model_version": "1.0.0",
            "tags": [
                "test",
                "example"
            ]
        },
        "framework": {
            "lib": "sklearn",
            "version": "1.5.2"
        },
        "id": "43dcc9bb-528f-47e7-b68b-a8b9aa6ffd22",
        "model": {
            "info": {
                "activation": "tanh",
                "alpha": 0.0001,
                "batch_size": "auto",
                "beta_1": 0.9,
                "beta_2": 0.999,
                "early_stopping": false,
                "epsilon": 1e-08,
                "hidden_layer_sizes": [
                    10
                ],
                "learning_rate": "constant",
                "learning_rate_init": 0.001,
                "max_fun": 15000,
                "max_iter": 2000,
                "momentum": 0.9,
                "n_iter_no_change": 10,
                "nesterovs_momentum": true,
                "power_t": 0.5,
                "random_state": null,
                "shuffle": true,
                "solver": "adam",
                "tol": 0.0001,
                "validation_fraction": 0.1,
                "verbose": false,
                "warm_start": false
            },
            "metrics": {
                "recall": "0.95"
            },
            "obj": "MLPClassifier",
            "params": {
                "solver": "adam"
            }
        },
        "timestamp": "2025-04-03T19:47:56.590410"
    }
}
```

The usefulness of the inspect command is that it allows us to visualise
all the relevant information associated to the model without having to load it,
and with the ease of a single command. This can be used to verify the model
integrity and version, amongst other things, within the context of a **continuous
integration and continuous deployment process**.

### Inline input prediction

Now that we know how to inspect a model, let's make a prediction by using the
predict command:

```console
echo '[[0, 0], [0, 1], [1, 0], [1, 1]]' | flama model sklearn_model.flm predict

[0, 1, 1, 0]
```

If we want to get a more human-readable output, we can use the **--pretty** option:

```console
echo '[[0, 0], [0, 1], [1, 0], [1, 1]]' | flama model sklearn_model.flm predict --pretty

[
    0,
    1,
    1,
    0
]
```

### File input prediction

The predict command can also be used to make predictions from a file:

```console
flama model sklearn_model.flm predict --file input.json --pretty

[
    0,
    1,
    1,
    0
]
```

The output of any prediction can be stored in a file by using the **--output** option:

```console
flama model sklearn_model.flm predict --input input.json --output output.json
```

### Piping several models together

The default behaviour of the predict command is to receive and return data through
the standard input and output. This allows us to pipe several models together
in a single command. For example, let's say we have models **model_a.flm** and **model_b.flm**,
and we need to make a prediction with **model_a.flm** and then use the output of that
prediction as input for **model_b.flm**. This can be done by using the following command:

```console
echo '[0, 1, 2, 3]' | flama model model_a.flm predict | flama model model_b.flm predict

[1, 0, 1, 0]
```

This can be generalised to consider as many models as you need by following the general
pattern:

```console
echo 'input' | flama model model_1.flm predict | flama model model_2.flm predict | ... | flama model model_n.flm predict
```
