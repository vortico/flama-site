title: Model resources
wip: false
---

Thus far we have shown how to [package models](/docs/machine-learning-api/packaging-models/) in order to
[add them](/docs/machine-learning-api/add-models/) to a <FlamaName/> App. The way in which ML models are added or what they
represent internally was not discussed in detail before, as that was not necessary for the purpose of previous sections.
However, it should be no surprise for us, _something_ happens under the hood when we add models. And, that "something"
is responsible for making the model object(s) accessible via HTTP request to certain URL(s). When we serve/add models
either by CLI **serve/start** or by using the syntax **app.models.add_model** we get the ability of interacting with the
model via the URL which is specified as parameter **path**. Here, interacting means:

- Obtaining a **JSON** representation of the model added, which contains all the parameters uniquely defining the model.
  We obtain this **JSON** representation by simply running a <Label color="green">GET</Label> request to the model URL, e.g.
  **http://127.0.0.1/sklearn/** for one of our examples.

- Obtaining predictions from the model added, which requires us to send the input data on which predictions will be run.
  We get such predictions via a <Label color="blue">POST</Label> requests with a data payload to the method predict of the model which is
  represented via the model-predict URL, e.g. **http://127.0.0.1/sklearn/predict/** for
  the same example.

This means, when we serve/add models, <FlamaName/> takes care of creating a **Resource** object per model automatically,
specifically a **ModelResource** object, which represents an API resource in the REST sense of the word. This object
defines the default way of interaction with the model itself by providing the methods just mentioned. A more thorough
discussion about the **Resource** class and its children classes can be found in [here](/docs/api-reference/resource/).
However, the convenience of the method **add_models** might not be sufficient for your purposes for the following
reasons:

- You need to customise the default methods
- You need to define new methods for the resource

In what follows you will learn how to add model resources in a more customised way with the class **ModelResource**.

## The ModelResource class

The best way to learn how to implement your own model resources is by example, as we've been doing so far with previous
concepts. For this reason, we are going to re-implement the endpoints **/predict/** and **/inspect/** (which come by
default when using the tools seen before to serve/add models automatically) as a good starting point to showcase the
steps and ingredients required. With these two examples you will develop a better understanding of the _magic_ which
happens under the hood when using either the CLI **serve/start**, or the method **app.models.add_model**.
After these examples, you'll learn how to implement a custom method to be served as an endpoint, together with
the built-ins provided by default (actually, via the [metaclass](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#metaclasses) **ModelResourceType**).

### Preamble

The first step (let's call it _preamble_) is to prepare our <FlamaName/> **app**, and all the ingredients needed to be
able to add custom model resources. This is exactly what you have here:

```python
# Standard import:
import flama
from flama import Flama

# New imports (not seen so far):
from flama.models import ModelResource, ModelResourceType
from flama.resources import resource_method

# Flama app instantiation:
app = Flama(
    title="Flama ML",
    version="0.1.0",
    description="Machine learning API using Flama 🔥",
)

# Model resources will be added here
# ( ... code ... )

# In case we want to make it a runnable script:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    flama.run(flama_app="__main__:app", server_host="0.0.0.0", server_port=8080, server_reload=True)
```

As can be seen, there are three ingredients imported which we haven't seen yet, namely:

- **ModelResource**: This is a <FlamaName /> built-in class which derives from the most fundamental resource
  class **BaseResource**. These classes can be seen as the interface that any custom model class will need to adhere
  to. In case you're not familiar with the interface design pattern, we like the definition given by [RealPython](https://realpython.com/python-interface/):

  > At a high level, an interface acts as a blueprint for designing classes.
  > Like classes, interfaces define methods. Unlike classes, these methods are abstract.
  > An abstract method is one that the interface simply defines. It doesn’t implement the methods.
  > This is done by classes, which then implement the interface and give concrete meaning to the interface’s abstract methods.

- **ModelResourceType**: This is a <FlamaName /> built-in metaclass which derives from the most fundamental
  resource type metaclass **ResourceType**. The concept of metaclass is a bit less intuitive, and some highly
  recognised pythonists recommend to avoid them:

  > Metaclasses are deeper magic than 99% of users should ever worry about. If you wonder whether you need them,
  > you don’t (the people who actually need them know with certainty that they need them, and don’t need an
  > explanation about why).
  >
  > - Tim Peters

  We agree with such a claim, which is why you won't need to worry about them, apart from having to import the
  **ModelResourceType**, and use it as an argument when building your custom model class.

- **resource_method**: This is a <FlamaName /> built-in decorator which allows us to convert a given class method into
  an **app** endpoint, with the following main arguments:

  - **path**: Route path through which we'll be able to call the decorated method, e.g. **/predict/**
  - **methods**: HTTP methods associated with the endpoint, e.g. **GET** or **POST**
  - **name**: Name which uniquely determines the route being added to the **app**.

### Predict

We can start with one of the endpoints given for granted when using the tools showed in previous
sections, namely **/predict/**. The way in which we build our own model resource is very
straightforward, we only need to use the following pattern:

```python
# FIXME: Missing schemas

class MySKModel(ModelResource, metaclass=ModelResourceType):
    # special names:
    verbose_name = "My ScikitLearn Model"
    model_path = "sklearn_model.flm"
    name = "sk_model"

    # FIXME: Missing types
    #       This won't work, but it's almost correct
    @resource_method("/predict", methods=["POST"], name="model-predict")
    def predict(self, data):
        return self.model.predict(data)
```

As we already said, this example is not functional (just yet). However, it contains a good
amount of the pieces required, so we can start talking about these ingredients:

- **MySKModel(ModelResource, metaclass=ModelResourceType)**: The very first thing needed is to
  create our own model-resource class, which means inheriting from **ModelResource**. However,
  that's only the interface, and we also need some extra magic which lives in the metaclass **ModelResourceType**.
  Only with these two ingredients, your model-resource class will be <FlamaName /> compliant.

- **Special attribute names**: These three attributes are mandatory for several purposes.
  The attribute **model_path** specifies where to find the binary file with the model,
  **verbose_name** defines a tag for the documentation, and **name** is used only internally,
  but required to uniquely identify the resource being added.

- **@resource_method**: The first argument determines the path associated to the method which
  the decorator accompanies to, e.g. **/predict/**. It also receives as parameter **methods**,
  which refers to the request methods to which this endpoint responds to (e.g. **POST**),
  and **name**, a parameter used internally to uniquely identify this endpoint.

It's time to know why we said the previous example won't work: it's all due to missing types and schemas.

<FlamaName /> is a strongly-typed-and-schema-specific framework. Wait, what? This only means that we need to provide the
schema type of the input and output arguments if we want any method to be <FlamaName /> compliant, and such schemas need
to be registered in the **app**.

What do we need to make this example a working example? Let's see what the correct code looks like:

```python
import typesystem as ts

# Definition of input (X) and ouput (Y) schemas
X = ts.Schema(fields={"input": ts.fields.Array()})
Y = ts.Schema(fields={"output": ts.fields.Array()})

# Registration of schemas:
app.schema.register_schema("X", X)
app.schema.register_schema("Y", Y)

class MySKModel(ModelResource, metaclass=ModelResourceType):
    # special names:
    verbose_name = "My ScikitLearn Model"
    model_path = "sklearn_model.flm"
    name = "sk_model"

    # Correct typed method with some documentation
    @resource_method("/predict/", methods=["POST"], name="model-predict")
    def predict(self, data: X) -> Y:
        """
        tags:
            - My ScikitLearn Model
        summary:
            Run predict method.
        description:
            This is a more detailed description of the predict method.
        responses:
            200:
                description: ML model prediction.
        """
        return {"output": self.model.predict(data["input"])}
```

You will notice the following changes:

- **typesystem.Schema**s: We've added two schemas to define the data type of the input and the output. We have
  used _typesystem_ for this purpose. If you don't remember how this python package got there, go back to
  [Quickstart](/docs/getting-started/quickstart/). Also, remember that <FlamaName /> is also compatible with
  **Marshmallow**. For more information about how to define schemas, we refer to their official documentation
  websites: [typesystem](https://www.encode.io/typesystem/), and [marshmallow](https://marshmallow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/),
  respectively.

- **app.schema.register_schema**: These lines appear right after the definition of our schemas, and they are intended
  to register the new data schemas in the **app**. This makes possible the automatic identification of body
  arguments in request, via the design pattern known as [dependency injection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection).
  The finer details on how this happens are left aside (we recommend the curious developer to dive into the code,
  taking advantage of the open code). In layman's terms, thanks to the registration of these schemas, <FlamaName />
  will be in charge of identifying what's what when a request comes accompanied by data by analysing the schema
  of the input data.

- **predict(self, data: X) -> Y**: Type hinting is mandatory, and (as we just mentioned) plays a key role in the
  dependency injection responsible for identifying and type-checking incoming data.

Finally, we can put all these pieces together and get a fully functional code. Thus, you should now be able to
**flama-run** it (this is how we _read_ the `flama run command line) after adding the previous code snippet
to the code introduced in the preamble. Or, if you prefer, you can get the full example from
[here](https://github.com/vortico/flama/blob/develop/examples/add_model_resource.py).

### Inspect

It shouldn't be a surprise that the other endpoint we got for free before, i.e. <Label color="green">GET</Label> **/**,
is completely analogous to the previous example. In the following code, we introduce a reimplementation of such method
under a different route in order to be able to compare both:

```python
class MyModel(ModelResource, metaclass=ModelResourceType):
    name = "my_model"
    verbose_name = "My ML model"
    model_path = "path/to/your_model_file.flm"

    @resource_method("/inspect/", methods=["GET"], name="model-inspect-model")
    def inspect_model(self):
        """
        tags:
            - My ScikitLearn Model
        summary:
            Get metadata info.
        description:
            This is a more detailed description of the method.
        responses:
            200:
                description: ML model info.
        """
        return {"params": self.model.inspect()}
```

### Custom methods

And, finally, let's add something completely custom to our model-resource. We will add a method to get information about the
model itself, which is not part of the model's API. This is a good example of how to add custom methods to your model-resource.
In particular, the method will return metadata information about the model, such as the name of the model,
the version of the library used to train it, and the version of the model itself. The code is as follows:

```python
class MyModel(ModelResource, metaclass=ModelResourceType):
    name = "my_model"
    verbose_name = "My ML model"
    model_path = "path/to/your_model_file.flm"

    # custom attributes
    info = {
        "model_version": "1.0.0",
        "library_version": "1.0.2",
    }

    @resource_method("/metadata/", methods=["GET"], name="metadata-method")
    def metadata(self):
        """
        tags:
            - My ScikitLearn Model
        summary:
            Get metadata info.
        description:
            This is a more detailed description of the method.
        responses:
            200:
                description: ML model metadata.
        """

        return {"metadata": {
            "built-in": {"verbose_name": self._meta.verbose_name, "name": self._meta.name},
            "custom": {**self.info, "date": datetime.now().date(), "time": datetime.now().time()},
        }}
```

## Adding the resource

Despite that we have said that the previous code is enough to make our model-resource work, we still need to add it to the
**app**. This can be done in two ways: explicitly or implicitly. The first one might seem more straightforward,
and it is indeed, but it is also more verbose. The second one is more concise, and only requires the use of a decorator
on top of the model-resource class definition. Let's see both ways:

### Explicit

```python
class MyModel(ModelResource, metaclass=ModelResourceType):
    ...

app.models.add_model_resource(path="/my_model", resource=MyModel)
```

### Decorator

```python
@app.models.model("/model")
class MyModel(ModelResource, metaclass=ModelResourceType):
    ...
```

With this, we have finished the implementation of our model resource. Now, we can run the app and test it. We can do so
by either running the **app** directly from our editor, or by using the **flama run** command line.
In the latter case, we can use the `--app-debug` flag to enable the debugging mode, which will allow us to use the interactive
debugger in case of an error. The following code shows how to run the app using the **flama run** command line:

```commandline
> flama run add_model_resource:app --app-debug
```

## Examples

So far, we have seen all the necessary steps to add a custom model resource to our **app**.
In particular a **ScikitLearn** model-resource. However, we have not shown how to implement a **PyTorch** or **TensorFlow**
resource. Actually, the steps are exactly the same for all.

In the following, we show the template code related to the implementation of a custom model resource for the different
libraries mentioned above. As customary already, we will be using the example FLM files generated in the previous section,
namely:

- [Scikit Learn model](/models/sklearn_model.flm)
- [TensorFlow model](/models/tensorflow_model.flm)
- [PyTorch model](/models/pytorch_model.flm)

### PyTorch

```python
@app.models.model("/pytorch_model/")
class PyTorchModel(ModelResource, metaclass=ModelResourceType):
    name = "pythorch_model"
    verbose_name = "PyTorch model"
    model_path = "pytorch_model.flm"

    info = {
        "model_version": "1.0.0",
        "library_version": "1.0.2",
    }

    @resource_method("/metadata/", methods=["GET"], name="pytorch-metadata")
    def metadata(self):
        """
        tags:
            - PyTorch model
        summary:
            Get metadata info.
        description:
            Method returning relevant metadata information.
        responses:
            200:
                description: ML model metadata.
        """

        return {"metadata": {
            "built-in": {"verbose_name": self._meta.verbose_name, "name": self._meta.name},
            "custom": {**self.info, "date": datetime.now().date(), "time": datetime.now().time()},
        }}
```

### Scikit-Learn

```python
@app.models.model("/sklearn_model/")
class SKLearnModel(ModelResource, metaclass=ModelResourceType):
    name = "pythorch_model"
    verbose_name = "ScikitLearn model"
    model_path = "sklearn_model.flm"

    info = {
        "model_version": "1.0.0",
        "library_version": "1.0.2",
    }

    @resource_method("/metadata/", methods=["GET"], name="sklearn-metadata")
    def metadata(self):
        """
        tags:
            - ScikitLearn model
        summary:
            Get metadata info.
        description:
            Method returning relevant metadata information.
        responses:
            200:
                description: ML model metadata.
        """

        return {"metadata": {
            "built-in": {"verbose_name": self._meta.verbose_name, "name": self._meta.name},
            "custom": {**self.info, "date": datetime.now().date(), "time": datetime.now().time()},
        }}
```

### TensorFlow

```python
@app.models.model("/tensorflow_model/")
class SKLearnModel(ModelResource, metaclass=ModelResourceType):
    name = "tensorflow_model"
    verbose_name = "TensorFlow model"
    model_path = "tensorflow_model.flm"

    info = {
        "model_version": "1.0.0",
        "library_version": "1.0.2",
    }

    @resource_method("/metadata/", methods=["GET"], name="tensorflow-metadata")
    def metadata(self):
        """
        tags:
            - TensorFlow model
        summary:
            Get metadata info.
        description:
            Method returning relevant metadata information.
        responses:
            200:
                description: ML model metadata.
        """

        return {"metadata": {
            "built-in": {"verbose_name": self._meta.verbose_name, "name": self._meta.name},
            "custom": {**self.info, "date": datetime.now().date(), "time": datetime.now().time()},
        }}
```

Once you have your custom model resource implemented, you can run the app and test it. The best way to check that everything
is working as expected is by navigating to the **/docs/** endpoint. This will show you the documentation of the **app**,
as well as the documentation of the custom model resource. In the following, we show the documentation of the custom
model resource for the **ScikitLearn** model:
