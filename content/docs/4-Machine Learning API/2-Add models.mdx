title: Add models to your App
wip: false
---

In this section we are going to introduce a new way of using FLM files, which will be useful for those who are
interested in developing their own <FlamaName/> App. There are several reasons why you can consider developing your own
app, e.g. amongst other reasons you might want:

- To add further functionality which is not built-in when using the <FlamaName/> CLI
- To gain control on fine details for technical reasons
- To learn by doing

This is perfectly okay, and normal. <FlamaName/> CLI is not a "one size fits all" answer. Indeed, there are some
characteristics of a <FlamaName/> App which we may need to customise, for which we need to develop the application
ourselves, e.g. **startup** or **shutdown** events, to name some examples.

## Base application

For the sake of consistency across our examples, we are going to consider the following base application:

```python
from flama import Flama, Route


class AppStatus:
    loaded = False


def home():
    """
    tags:
        - Home
    summary:
        Returns readiness message
    description:
        The function returns a readiness message in which the global variable AppStatus.loaded is shown.
        If the 'on_startup' function has worked as expected, the message will show the 'loaded' variable as True.
        Else, it'll show the variable as 'False'
    """
    return f"The API is ready. Loaded = {AppStatus.loaded}"


def user_me():
    """
    tags:
        - User
    summary:
        Returns hello 'John Doe'
    description:
        The function returns the plain-text message "Hello John Doe"
    """
    username = "John Doe"
    return f"Hello {username}"


def user(username: str):
    """
    tags:
        - User
    summary:
        Returns hello 'username'
    description:
        The function returns the plain-text message "Hello 'username'" where the 'username' is the user specified as
        query parameter.
    """
    return f"Hello {username}"


app = Flama(
    title="Flama ML",
    version="0.1.0",
    description="Machine learning API using Flama 🔥",
    routes=[
        Route("/", home),
        Route('/user/me', user_me),
        Route('/user/{username}', user),
    ],
)
```

As can be seen, we have used a non-standard configuration of the application by using the parameters:

- **routes**: A list of routes to serve incoming HTTP and WebSocket requests. In this particular case,
- **events**: A dictionary of events to run on application startup and shutdown. The dictionary has two keys:
  - **startup**: A list of callables to run on application startup. Startup handler callables do not take any
    arguments, and may be either standard functions, or async functions.
  - **shutdown**: A list of callables to run on application shutdown. Shutdown handler callables do not take any
    arguments, and may be either standard functions, or async functions.

We suggest to save the previous example in a local file, say **examples/add_models.py**, and run it with the CLI:

```console
flama run examples.base_application:app

INFO:     Will watch for changes in these directories: ['/{YOUR_WORKING_DIRECTORY}/']
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
INFO:     Started reloader process [35011] using WatchFiles
INFO:     Started server process [35034]
INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
INFO:     Application startup complete.
```

### Adding events

Let us now add the **startup** and **shutdown** events to the application. We can do this by adding the following
functions to the application, and then adding them to the **events** dictionary to the **Flama** constructor:

```python
# Here the same code as before

def startup():
    print("\nStarting up the ML API...\n")
    # Here, whatever action we want to be run at the startup of the application
    AppStatus.loaded = True


def shutdown():
    print("\nShutting down the ML API...\n")
    # Here, whatever action we want to be run at the shutdown of the application

app = Flama(
    title="Flama ML",
    version="0.1.0",
    description="Machine learning API using Flama 🔥",
    routes=[
        Route("/", home),
        Route('/user/me', user_me),
        Route('/user/{username}', user),
    ],
    events={
        "startup": [startup],
        "shutdown": [shutdown],
    },
)
```

If we run the application again, we should get the following output:

```console
flama run examples.base_application:app

INFO:     Will watch for changes in these directories: ['/{YOUR_WORKING_DIRECTORY}/']
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
INFO:     Started reloader process [35011] using WatchFiles
INFO:     Started server process [35034]
INFO:     Waiting for application startup.

Starting up the ML API...

INFO:     Application startup complete.
```

If we click on the URL given above (i.e., **http://127.0.0.1:8000**), we should get the following message in our
browser:

```console
"The API is ready. Loaded = True"
```

### Events decorators

There is an alternative way of adding the events to the application, which is to use the **on_event** decorator.
The following example shows how to achieve the same result as the previous one:

```python
from flama import Flama, Route

# Here the same code as before but removing the definitions of startup and shutdown functions

app = Flama(
    title="Flama ML",
    version="0.1.0",
    description="Machine learning API using Flama 🔥",
    routes=[
        Route("/", home),
        Route('/user/me', user_me),
        Route('/user/{username}', user),
    ],
)

@app.on_event("startup")
def startup():
    print("\nStarting up the ML API...\n")
    # Here, whatever action we want to be run at the startup of the application
    AppStatus.loaded = True

@app.on_event("shutdown")
def shutdown():
    print("\nShutting down the ML API...\n")
    # Here, whatever action we want to be run at the shutdown of the application
```

This is just a quick example to show the effect of **startup** and **shutdown** events. They are very
convenient when we need the application to have some initialisation or deactivation steps which are specific of our
particular situation.

## Add models

Following the steps described in the previous [section](/docs/machine-learning-api/packaging-models/), it should be
straightforward to produce ML models packaged in FLM format. What we want now is to expose such models as
[Resources](/docs/machine-learning-api/model-resource/) of a <FlamaName/> App. This is what constitutes what we refer to
as a Flama ML API.

We already have the base <FlamaName/> App up and running in development mode. Let's start adding ML models to it in
live. This will be a good example to see by ourselves the advantages of running the app in development mode.

Any <FlamaName/> App will have accessible the attribute **models**, which will have the method **add_model** at our
disposal. The standard usage of this method will be as follows:

```python
app.models.add_model(
    path="path/to/model",
    model="path/to/your_model_file.flm",
    name="model_name",
)
```

Let's examine what we need:

- **app**: The <FlamaName/> App we are developing, and under which we want to serve ML models
- **path**: The URL path to find the model resource
- **model**: The local file path where the FLM file is at
- **name**: A custom name for the ML model resource for documenting purposes

Having a good understanding of what's needed, we can now proceed with some examples.

## Examples

As has been the case throughout this documentation so far, we will be using the example FLM files generated in the
previous section, namely:

- [Scikit Learn model](/models/sklearn_model.flm)
- [TensorFlow model](/models/tensorflow_model.flm)
- [PyTorch model](/models/pytorch_model.flm)

### Scikit-Learn

To proceed, we will need to add the following lines to the base application which is running (i.e., to the file
**examples/add_models.py**):

```python
app.models.add_model(
    path="/sklearn/",
    model="examples/sklearn_model.flm",
    name="sklean-model",
)
```

Right after adding and saving the document, we should see the reloading of the application happening on our terminal,
something like:

```console
...
WARNING:  WatchFiles detected changes in 'examples/add_models.py'. Reloading...
INFO:     Started server process [48286]
INFO:     Waiting for application startup.

Starting up the ML API...

INFO:     Application startup complete.
```

As we already anticipated when we introduced the [serve](/docs/flama-cli/serve) command, the model added will
automatically have associated the following endpoints:

- <Label color="green">GET</Label> **/sklearn/** Returns the model resource, i.e. the model hyper-parameter's schema which
  would be obtained with the method **get_params()**.
- <Label color="blue">POST</Label> **/sklearn/predict/** Expects the input data (observations) to be passed as argument to
  predict their output.

Check the documentation at **http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs/**, you should see something like:

<img src="/images/docs/docs-mlapi-sklearn.png" alt="docs-mlapi-sklearn" width="1600" height="925" />

### TensorFlow

As we probably are guessing, we can add TensorFlow models by adding the following lines to the base application:

```python
app.models.add_model(
    path="/tensorflow/",
    model="examples/tensorflow_model.flm",
    name="tensorflow-model",
)
```

Right after adding and saving the document, we should see the reloading of the application happening on our terminal,
something like:

```console
...
WARNING:  WatchFiles detected changes in 'examples/add_models.py'. Reloading...
INFO:     Started server process [48286]
INFO:     Waiting for application startup.

Starting up the ML API...

INFO:     Application startup complete.
```

Just like it happened with the scikit-learn model, our tensorflow models will automatically have associated the
following endpoints:

- <Label color="green">GET</Label> **/tensorflow/** Returns the model resource, i.e. the model hyper-parameter's schema which
  would be obtained with the method **to_json()**.
- <Label color="blue">POST</Label> **/tensorflow/predict/** Expects the input data (observations) to be passed as argument
  to predict their output.

Check the documentation at **http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs/**, you should see something like:

<img src="/images/docs/docs-mlapi-sklearn.png" alt="docs-mlapi-sklearn" width="1600" height="925" />

### PyTorch

As we can expect, there is no difference in adding PyTorch models to the already running application:

```python
app.models.add_model(
    path="/pytorch/",
    model="examples/pytorch_model.flm",
    name="pytorch-model",
)
```

Right after adding and saving the document, we should see the reloading of the application happening on our terminal,
something like:

```console
...
WARNING:  WatchFiles detected changes in 'examples/add_models.py'. Reloading...
INFO:     Started server process [48286]
INFO:     Waiting for application startup.

Starting up the ML API...

INFO:     Application startup complete.
```

Just like it happened with the scikit-learn model, and with the TensorFlow model, our PyTorch models will automatically
have associated the following endpoints:

- <Label color="green">GET</Label> **/pytorch/** Returns the model resource, i.e. the model hyper-parameter's schema which
  would be obtained with the following code:

  ```python
  {
    "modules": [str(x) for x in self.model.modules()],
    "parameters": {k: str(v) for k, v in self.model.named_parameters()},
    "state": self.model.state_dict(),
  }
  ```

- <Label color="blue">POST</Label> **/pytorch/predict/** Expects the input data (observations) to be passed as argument to
  predict their output.

Check the documentation at **http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs/**, you should see something like:

<img src="/images/docs/docs-mlapi-sklearn.png" alt="docs-mlapi-sklearn" width="1600" height="925" />

### Multiple models

A great advantage of the **models** module is that it can store as many models as we need. Thus, if we want to serve the
three models of our prior examples at once, we only need to put together the three examples of **add_model**, as
follows:

```python
from flama import Flama, Route


class AppStatus:
    loaded = False


def startup():
    print("\nStarting up the ML API...\n")
    # Here, whatever action we want to be run at the startup of the application
    AppStatus.loaded = True


def shutdown():
    print("\nShutting down the ML API...\n")
    # Here, whatever action we want to be run at the shutdown of the application


def home():
    """
    tags:
        - Home
    summary:
        Returns readiness message
    description:
        The function returns a readiness message in which the global variable AppStatus.loaded is shown.
        If the 'on_startup' function has worked as expected, the message will show the 'loaded' variable as True.
        Else, it'll show the variable as 'False'
    """
    return f"The API is ready. Loaded = {AppStatus.loaded}"


def user_me():
    """
    tags:
        - User
    summary:
        Returns hello 'John Doe'
    description:
        The function returns the plain-text message "Hello John Doe"
    """
    username = "John Doe"
    return f"Hello {username}"


def user(username: str):
    """
    tags:
        - User
    summary:
        Returns hello 'username'
    description:
        The function returns the plain-text message "Hello 'username'" where the 'username' is the user specified as
        query parameter.
    """
    return f"Hello {username}"


app = Flama(
    title="Flama ML",
    version="0.1.0",
    description="Machine learning API using Flama 🔥",
    routes=[
        Route("/", home),
        Route('/user/me', user_me),
        Route('/user/{username}', user),
    ],
    on_startup=[startup],
    on_shutdown=[shutdown]
)


app.models.add_model(
    path="/sklearn/",
    model="examples/sklearn_model.flm",
    name="logistic-regression",
)


app.models.add_model(
    path="/tensorflow/",
    model="examples/tensorflow_model.flm",
    name="tensorflow-neural-network",
)


app.models.add_model(
    path="/pytorch/",
    model="examples/pytorch_model.flm",
    name="pytorch-model",
)
```

If we run this example, our <FlamaName/> app will have the following endpoints:

- <Label color="green">GET</Label> **/**: Returns a readiness message in which the global variable AppStatus.loaded is shown.
  If the 'on_startup' function has worked as expected, the message will show the 'loaded' variable as True. Else, it'll show
  the variable as 'False'
- <Label color="green">GET</Label> **/user/me/**: Returns the plain-text message "Hello John Doe"
- <Label color="green">GET</Label> **/user/\{username\}/**: Returns the plain-text message "Hello 'username'" where the
'username' is the user specified as query parameter
- <Label color="green">GET</Label> **/sklearn/**: Returns the representation of the model resource, i.e. a JSON with all
  the hyper-parameters of the model
- <Label color="blue">POST</Label> **/sklearn/predict/**: Returns a ScikitLearn model prediction when provided with an input
  data array
- <Label color="green">GET</Label> **/tensorflow/**: Returns the representation of the model resource, i.e. a JSON with all
  the hyper-parameters of the model
- <Label color="blue">POST</Label> **/tensorflow/predict/**: Returns a TensorFlow model prediction when provided with an
  input data array
- <Label color="green">GET</Label> **/pytorch/**: Returns the representation of the model resource, i.e. a JSON with all
  the hyper-parameters of the model
- <Label color="blue">POST</Label> **/pytorch/predict/**: Returns a PyTorch model prediction when provided with an input
  data array
