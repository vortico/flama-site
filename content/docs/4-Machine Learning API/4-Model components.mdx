title: Model components

In the previous section we covered the fundamentals of building custom model resources. Understanding
what model resources are, and how to use them, was the first step in building a custom model. We took
advantage of the <FlamaName /> built-in **ModelResource** to create a custom
model resource that incorporated custom methods and exposed them as routes of our API,
beyond the standard **/predict/** and **/inspect/** routes added by default when using <FlamaName /> CLI,
or the syntax **app.models.add_model** (see the sections about [adding models](/docs/machine-learning-api/add-models/#add-models) and
[adding model resources](/docs/machine-learning-api/model-resource/#adding-the-resource) for more details).
Without us knowing, when we created our custom model resource, <FlamaName /> added it as a _Component_
of the application (specifically, as a _ModelComponent_). But, what is a component? And what is a model component?

Before we dive into the details of the **ModelComponent** class, let's first understand what a **Component**
and a **ModelComponent** represent within the context of a <FlamaName /> application. These are very important
concepts, as they will help us understand how to extend the functionality of our application.
Once we have a good understanding of these concepts, we will provide an example of how to build a

<FlamaName /> application that uses a custom model component which incorporates a lazy loading mechanism. The example
will show us the power of being able to control the finest details of our models.

- **What is a component?** <FlamaName /> **Components** are the building blocks of an application. Components are an abstraction which allow us to
  isolate the logic required to create the objects needed by the application methods exposed as routes. Whenever an
  application route receives a request, it will call the corresponding method of the application which encapsulates the
  functionality responsible for yielding the desired response. Such functionality typically requires objects to be
  created, and these objects are instantiated by the application **Components**. Thus, **Components** permits us to isolate
  the logic that's not directly related to the application's business logic, and to reuse it across different application
  methods. A natural question at this point could be: "what are these objects that components create?". The answer is: They can be anything!
  They can be: a query parameter, a body, a database connection, a machine learning model, etc.

- **What is a model component?** One of the built-in components of <FlamaName /> is the **ModelComponent**. This component is responsible for creating
  the objects that are required by the application methods in charge of handling the requests to (at least)
  the **/predict/** and **/inspect/** routes. This means, whenever a request which requires an ML model is received
  (e.g., to make a prediction, or to inspect the model), the **ModelComponent** will be resolving automatically the
  creation of the corresponding ML model object. If you are asking yourself _what a lazy loading mechanism is_, here
  is a brief explanation: A lazy loading mechanism is a mechanism that allows us to delay the creation of an object
  until it is actually needed. This is useful when we want to avoid the overhead of creating an object that we might
  For example, if we have a machine learning model that takes a long time to load, we might want to defer the creation
  of the model until it is actually needed. This way, we can avoid the loading time of the model at the startup,
  reducing the time it takes for our application to be ready to receive requests.

## The ModelComponent class

### Preamble

The best way to know how to implement our own **ModelComponent** is by example, as we've been doing so far in previous
sections. With this purpose in mind, we are going to build a <FlamaName /> application which loads a machine learning
model only when the first request to any of the **/predict/** or **/inspect/** routes is received.
To do so, we will need:

- A custom **Model** class which wraps the methods of the machine learning model we want to use.
  In this example, we will implement the **predict** and **inspect** methods of the model.

- A custom **ModelComponent** class which will be in charge of instantiating our custom **Model**
  class, and return it via the **resolve** method. We need to highlight that the **resolve** method
  is the one that is called by the dependency injection of <FlamaName /> framework, hence its
  **mandatory** character, and implementation.

- A custom **ModelResource** class which will be in charge of exposing the **predict** and **inspect**
  methods of our custom **Model** class as routes of our API. This is, in essence, the same class we implemented
  in the previous section. We will also expose an additional method, as we did in the previous section, which
  will return some metadata, including the status of the model (whether it is loaded or not).

### Model

Let's start implementing the easiest of the ingredients we have mentioned above:

```python
import typing
from flama.models import Model

class MyCustomModel(Model):
    def inspect(self) -> typing.Any:
        return self.model.inspect()

    def predict(self, x: typing.Any) -> typing.Any:
        return self.model.predict(x)
```

As we can see, the **MyCustomModel** class inherits from the **Model** class, which is a built-in class of <FlamaName />.
This base class provides the initialisation of the **model** attribute, and the **inspect** and **predict** methods,
which will be exposed as routes of our application. If we wanted to instantiate a model object of the class
**MyCustomModel**, we would need to pass the model object as an argument to the constructor, as follows:

```python
model_artifact = flama.load("sklearn_model.flm")
model = MyCustomModel(model_artifact.model)
```

### ModelComponent

Now that we have the **Model** class implemented, we need the **ModelComponent** class. This class will be in charge
of instantiating the **MyCustomModel** class, and returning it via the **resolve** method. In this particular example,
we are going to implement a lazy loading mechanism, which means that the model will be instantiated only when the
first request to any of the **/predict/** or **/inspect/** routes is received. This is different from what was done
under the hood by <FlamaName /> when we used the **app.models.add_model** or **app.models.add_model_resource**.
In both cases there was a **ModelComponent** which was created without us knowing, but the instantiation of the
model object occurs in the **resolve** method directly, hence the model is instantiated at the startup of the
application. In our case, we want to delay the instantiation of the model until the first _relevant_ request happens.
Therefore, the **resolve** method will not be the one making the call to the constructor of the **MyCustomModel** class.
Instead, we will implement a method called **load_model** which will be in charge of instantiating the model object.
The **resolve** method will call the **load_model** method, and return the model object, if the object is not initialised
yet. Without further ado, let's implement our **ModelComponent** class:

```python
from flama.models import ModelComponent

class MyCustomModelComponent(ModelComponent):
    def __init__(self, model_path: str):
        self._model_path = model_path
        self.model = MyCustomModel(None, meta=None)

    def load_model(self):
        model_obj = flama.load(self._model_path)
        self.model = MyCustomModel(model_obj.model, meta=model_obj.meta)

    def unload_model(self):
        self.model = MyCustomModel(None, meta=None)

    def resolve(self) -> MyCustomModel:
        if not self.model.model:
            self.load_model()

        return self.model
```

In short, to instantiate an object of the **MyCustomModelComponent** class, we need to pass the path to the model object as an
argument to the constructor. This path will be stored in the **self.\_model_path** attribute. The **self.model**
attribute is an instance of the **MyCustomModel** class, which is initialised with a **None** value, which makes it
lightweight by default. The **load_model** method is in charge of instantiating the model object, and
assigning it to the **self.model** attribute. We've also added an **unload_model** method, which is in charge of
setting the **self.model** attribute to a **None** value, i.e. to reset the model attribute.
Finally, the **resolve** method is in charge of calling the **load_model** method, if the **self.model** attribute
is not initialised yet, and returning the **self.model** attribute.

How will we have to initialise the **MyCustomModelComponent** class? We will have to do it as follows:

```python
component = MyCustomModelComponent("sklearn_model.flm")
```

The object **component** will be passed to the last of the ingredients we need to implement the **ModelComponent**,
namely the **ModelResource** class.

### ModelResource

We have already implemented the **ModelResource** class in the previous section, so we will not go into all the details
of the implementation. The only difference with the previous section is that we are not going to use the
**model_path** class attribute this time. This class attribute is used to instantiate a **ModelComponent** object
internally. However, we have our own **ModelComponent** class, so we don't want <FlamaName /> to create a
**ModelComponent** object for us. Instead, we want to pass our own **ModelComponent** object to the **ModelResource**,
and this is what we are going to do. Let's see how:

```python
class MyCustomModelResource(ModelResource):
    name = "custom_model"
    verbose_name = "Lazy-loaded ScikitLearn Model"
    component = component

    info = {
        "model_version": "1.0.0",
        "library_version": "1.0.2",
    }

    def _get_metadata(self):
        return {
            "metadata": {
                "built-in": {
                    "verbose_name": self._meta.verbose_name,
                    "name": self._meta.name,
                },
                "custom": {
                    **self.info,
                    "loaded": self.component.model.model is not None,
                    "date": datetime.now().date(),
                    "time": datetime.now().time()
                },
            }
        }

    @resource_method("/unload/", methods=["GET"], name="unload-method")
    def unload(self):
        """
        tags:
            - Lazy-loaded ScikitLearn Model
        summary:
            Unload the model.
        """
        self.component.unload_model()
        return self._get_metadata()

    @resource_method("/metadata/", methods=["GET"], name="metadata-method")
    def metadata(self):
        """
        tags:
            - Lazy-loaded ScikitLearn Model
        summary:
            Get metadata info.
        """
        return self._get_metadata()
```

As we can see, the only difference with the implementation we saw in the previous section is that we are using the
class attribute **component**, which we are setting to the **component** object we instantiated earlier. Obviously,
we are also adding the **unload** method, which is in charge of calling the **unload_model** method of the
**MyCustomModelComponent** class. The **metadata** method is also different, as it is now returning the **loaded**
attribute, which is a boolean value indicating whether the model is loaded or not. The **loaded** attribute is
obtained by checking whether the **self.component.model.model** attribute is **None** or not. If it is **None**,
then the model is not loaded, and if it is not **None**, then the model is loaded. This will be useful for us to
check whether the lazy loading mechanism is working as expected. Finally, we could avoid the instantiation of the
**component** object by calling the **MyCustomModelComponent** class directly in the **component** class attribute.
This would look something like this:

```python
class MyCustomModelResource(ModelResource):
    name = "custom_model"
    verbose_name = "Lazy-loaded ScikitLearn Model"
    component = MyCustomModelComponent("sklearn_model.flm")

    # rest of the code ...
```

## Adding the component

Now that we have implemented the **ModelComponent** and the **ModelResource**, we need to add our custom model component
to our application. As we can see below, the procedure is quite similar to the way in which we added a model
resource in the previous section:

```python
app = Flama(
    title="Flama ML",
    version="0.1.0",
    description="Machine learning API using Flama 🔥",
    docs="/docs/",
)

app.add_component(component)
app.models.add_model_resource(path="/model", resource=MyCustomModelResource)
```

This is the most verbose way of adding it. We could also add it by using the **component** argument of the

<FlamaName /> class constructor:

```python
app = Flama(
    title="Flama ML",
    version="0.1.0",
    description="Machine learning API using Flama 🔥",
    docs="/docs/",
    components=[component],
)

app.models.add_model_resource(path="/model", resource=MyCustomModelResource)
```

### Run

Putting everything together, we have the following code:

```python
import typing
from datetime import datetime

import flama
from flama import Flama
from flama.models import Model, ModelResource, ModelComponent
from flama.resources import resource_method


class MyCustomModel(Model):
    def inspect(self) -> typing.Any:
        return self.model.get_params()

    def predict(self, x: typing.Any) -> typing.Any:
        return self.model.predict(x)


class MyCustomModelComponent(ModelComponent):

    def __init__(self, model_path: str):
        self._model_path = model_path
        self.model = MyCustomModel(None)

    def load_model(self):
        self.model = MyCustomModel(flama.load(self._model_path).model)

    def unload_model(self):
        self.model = MyCustomModel(None)

    def resolve(self) -> MyCustomModel:
        if not self.model.model:
            self.load_model()

        return self.model


component = MyCustomModelComponent("sklearn_model.flm")


class MyCustomModelResource(ModelResource):
    name = "custom_model"
    verbose_name = "Lazy-loaded ScikitLearn Model"
    component = component

    info = {
        "model_version": "1.0.0",
        "library_version": "1.0.2",
    }

    def _get_metadata(self):
        return {
            "metadata": {
                "built-in": {
                    "verbose_name": self._meta.verbose_name,
                    "name": self._meta.name,
                },
                "custom": {
                    **self.info,
                    "loaded": self.component.model.model is not None,
                    "date": datetime.now().date(),
                    "time": datetime.now().time()
                },
            }
        }

    @resource_method("/unload/", methods=["GET"], name="unload-method")
    def unload(self):
        """
        tags:
            - Lazy-loaded ScikitLearn Model
        summary:
            Unload the model.
        """
        self.component.unload_model()
        return self._get_metadata()

    @resource_method("/metadata/", methods=["GET"], name="metadata-method")
    def metadata(self):
        """
        tags:
            - Lazy-loaded ScikitLearn Model
        summary:
            Get metadata info.
        """
        return self._get_metadata()


app = Flama(
    title="Flama ML",
    version="0.1.0",
    description="Machine learning API using Flama 🔥",
    docs="/docs/",
    components=[component],
)

app.models.add_model_resource(path="/model", resource=MyCustomModelResource)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    flama.run(flama_app="__main__:app", server_host="0.0.0.0", server_port=8080, server_reload=True)
```

Now we only have to run the application, and we will be able to test our custom model component.
As always, the best way to check that everything is working as expected is by navigating to the **/docs/** endpoint.
This will show you the documentation of the app:

<img
  src="/images/docs/docs-add-model-component-docs.png"
  alt="docs-add-model-component-docs"
  width="1600"
  height="590"
/>

### Testing the lazy loading mechanism

To check that the lazy loading mechanism is working as expected, we can navigate to the section _Get metadata info_,
and click on _Send API Request_. This will return the following response:

<img
  src="/images/docs/docs-add-model-component-metadata-false.png"
  alt="docs-add-model-component-metadata"
  width="1600"
  height="1043"
/>

As can be seen, the **loaded** attribute is **false**, which means that the model is not loaded. Now, we can navigate
to the section _Retrieve the model section_ (which calls the **/inspect/** endpoint), and click on _Send API Request_.
This will return the following response:

<img
  src="/images/docs/docs-add-model-component-inspect.png"
  alt="docs-add-model-component-inspect"
  width="1600"
  height="1070"
/>

If we navigate again to the section _Get metadata info_, and click on _Send API Request_, we will see that the **loaded**
attribute is now **true**. This means that the model has been loaded:

<img
  src="/images/docs/docs-add-model-component-metadata-true.png"
  alt="docs-add-model-component-metadata-false"
  width="1600"
  height="1043"
/>

Finally, we can navigate to the section _Unload the model_, and click on _Send API Request_. This will return the following
response:

<img
  src="/images/docs/docs-add-model-component-unload.png"
  alt="docs-add-model-component-unload"
  width="1600"
  height="1043"
/>

which informs us immediately that the model has been unloaded.

🥳 Hurrah! Everything is working as expected. We have successfully added a custom model component to our application.

## Examples

So far, we have seen all the necessary steps to add a custom model resource to our **app**.
In particular a **ScikitLearn** model component. However, we have not shown how to implement a **PyTorch** or **TensorFlow**
component. Actually, the steps are exactly the same for all.

In the following, we show the template code related to the implementation of a custom model component for the different
libraries mentioned above. As customary already, we will be using the example FLM files generated in the previous section,
namely:

- [Scikit Learn model](/models/sklearn_model.flm)
- [TensorFlow model](/models/tensorflow_model.flm)
- [PyTorch model](/models/pytorch_model.flm)

In this case, the change required to use one or another library is minimal. In particular, we only need to change the
class attribute **component**.

### PyTorch

```python
component = MyCustomModelComponent("pytorch_model.flm")

class MyModelResource(ModelResource):
    name = "custom_model"
    verbose_name = "Lazy-loaded PyTorch Model"
    component = component

    # ...
```

### Scikit-learn

```python
component = MyCustomModelComponent("sklearn_model.flm")

class MyModelResource(ModelResource):
    name = "custom_model"
    verbose_name = "Lazy-loaded ScikitLearn Model"
    component = component

    # ...
```

### TensorFlow

```python
component = MyCustomModelComponent("tensorflow_model.flm")

class MyModelResource(ModelResource):
    name = "custom_model"
    verbose_name = "Lazy-loaded TensorFlow Model"
    component = component

    # ...
```

## Conclusion

We have seen how to add a custom model component to our application. In particular, we have seen how to implement
model component which loads the model lazily. This is a very useful feature, as it allows us to save memory and
resources when the application is not being used. This has allowed us to create a completely customised
machine learning API using <FlamaName />. With this, we hope you have reached a good understanding of how to
use <FlamaName /> to create your own machine learning API, and how to add custom components to it, which will
be necessary in your projects very likely. Feel free to use the code provided in this tutorial as a starting point
for your own projects, and to modify it as you see fit. We hope you become a <FlamaName /> ambassador, and that
you share your experience with us. We will be very happy to hear form your experience with <FlamaName />.
