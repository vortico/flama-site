## Serve machine-learning models

In the previous section we have introduced the command **run** of <FlamaName /> CLI. The **run** command allowed us to
serve any <FlamaName /> app, being possible to adapt the configuration of the app using the standard **uvicorn**
arguments. But this is not the end of the story.

The command **serve** comes to the rescue of those who are looking for an instantaneous serving of an ML model without
having to write an app. This command, as we are about to see, only requires the ML model to be served. The model will
have to be saved as a binary file beforehand by using the tools offered by <FlamaName />. The details about how to
properly save the models can be found in the section [packaging models](/docs/machine-learning-api/packaging-models/).

### Example files

The best way of seeing the power of **serve** is by example. Although we have not yet seen how to produce the ML file
needed (go to [packaging models](/docs/machine-learning-api/packaging-models/) to learn how), we can use any of the
following example files for the sake of learning:

- [Scikit Learn model](/models/sklearn_model.flm)
- [TensorFlow model](/models/tensorflow_model.flm)
- [PyTorch model](/models/pytorch_model.flm)

Once you have downloaded any of the files listed above, you will be able to serve your first ML model codeless.

## Codeless serving

Let's pick up one of the example model files we have just introduced in the previous section, say **sklearn_model.flm**.
Now, let's run:

```console
flama serve sklearn_model.flm

INFO:     Started server process [15822]
INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
INFO:     Application startup complete.
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

Does it seem familiar? Yup, indeed, as you can see we have a <FlamaName /> app up and running on **http://127.0.0.1**
and listening via the port **8000**. But, this time we have not written a single line of code! This is the **codeless
approach** of <FlamaName /> to ML models deployment, which makes possible the deployment of an already trained-tested ML
model as an API ready to receive requests and return estimations almost without any effort.

### How do we interact with the model?

So, we have an app which is running an ML model. The natural question to ask now is, how do we interact with that model?
All models served with **flama serve** come with the following endpoints for free:

- <Label color="green">GET</Label> **http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs/**: Returns an interactive HTML documentation which allows
  us to interact with the model in our web browser. This is the recommended way to start interacting with the model, as it
  informs us about all the routes available, and helps us to figure how to programmatically interact with all other routes.
- <Label color="green">GET</Label> **http://127.0.0.1:8000/schema/**: Returns a JSON which represents the model being served.
- <Label color="blue">POST</Label> **http://127.0.0.1:8000/predict/** Expects the input data (observations) to be passed
  as argument to predict their output.

### Interactive and intuitive documentation

As mentioned in the previous section, we recommend inspecting the documentation route (`/docs/`) as soon as we have the
model serving. To do that you only need to **flama serve** whatever model which you have packaged previously, and you'll
get something like:

<img src="/images/docs/docs-schema-get.png" alt="docs-get-schema" width="1600" height="400" />

As you can see, the documentation page not only gives you a handy way to interact with the different endpoints
available, but also gives you the equivalent `curl` statement. For instance, in order to get the schema of the model:

```console
curl --request GET \
  --url http://127.0.0.1:8000/ \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json'

{
  "id": "621c1d8a-144a-4a86-9a9c-9157f80bfa2d",
  "timestamp": "2023-03-10T11:30:00",
  "framework": {
    "lib": "sklearn",
    "version": "1.2.2"
  },
  "model": {
    "obj": "MLPClassifier",
    "info": {
      "activation": "tanh",
      "alpha": 0.0001,
      "batch_size": "auto",
      "beta_1": 0.9,
      "beta_2": 0.999,
      "early_stopping": false,
      "epsilon": 1e-8,
      "hidden_layer_sizes": [
        10
      ],
      "learning_rate": "constant",
      "learning_rate_init": 0.001,
      "max_fun": 15000,
      "max_iter": 2000,
      "momentum": 0.9,
      "n_iter_no_change": 10,
      "nesterovs_momentum": true,
      "power_t": 0.5,
      "random_state": null,
      "shuffle": true,
      "solver": "adam",
      "tol": 0.0001,
      "validation_fraction": 0.1,
      "verbose": false,
      "warm_start": false
    },
    "params": {
      "optimizer": "adams"
    },
    "metrics": {
      "recall": "0.95"
    }
  },
  "extra": {
    "model_version": "1.0.0",
    "model_description": "This is a test model",
    "model_author": "John Doe",
    "model_license": "MIT",
    "tags": [
      "test",
      "example"
    ]
  }
}
```

Or, in case we want to make a prediction:

<img src="/images/docs/docs-predict-post.png" alt="docs-post-predict" width="1600" height="1135" />

```console
curl --request POST \
  --url http://127.0.0.1:8000/predict/ \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
  "input": [
    [0, 0], [1, 0], [0, 1], [0, 0]
  ]
}'

{
  "output": [
    0,
    1,
    1,
    0
  ]
}
```

🥳 Awesome! Now, not only you have your model serving, but you also made predictions by interacting with it
programmatically. The cool thing about this, is that this way of interacting with your model via _requests_ is the same,
no matter where the model is deployed. And, this is a huge step towards the productionalization of your model. Now, we
have a reproducible problem, which is key to understand and replicate the behaviour of our models in a production
environment, since it'll be the same as we observe in local.

## Parameters

Although the default usage of **flama serve** is already very convenient, you might be interested in customise a bit the
result. For instance, you might want to serve the model at a different route (i.e., not at the default **/**), or the
name of the model (i.e., not **model**), and so on. Such a customisation is possible thanks to the different optional
inputs of the CLI:

```console
flama serve --help

  --server-h11-max-incomplete-event-size INTEGER

  --help                          Show this message and exit.
```

We can readily see the following groups of parameters:

### Model parameters

- **model-url**: Route of the model (default: /)
- **model-name**: Name of the model (default: model)

### App parameters

- **app-debug**: Enable debug mode (default: False)
- **app-title**: Name of the application (default: Flama)
- **app-version**: Version of the application (default: 0.1.0)
- **app-description**: Description of the application (default: Fire up) with the flame]
- **app-docs**: Description of the application (default: Fire up) with the flame]
- **app-schema**: Description of the application (default: Fire up) with the flame]

The parameter **app-debug** brings with it useful tools which make the debugging of the code easier,
e.g. highly-detailed error messages, and interactive error webpages.

### Server parameters

All [uvicorn options](https://www.uvicorn.org/settings/) can be passed to the command **serve** with the format
`server-<UVICORN_OPTION_NAME>`, as we discussed for the command [run](/docs/flama-cli/run/), e.g.:

- **server-host**: Bind socket to this host (default: 127.0.0.1)
- **server-port**: Bind socket to this port (default: 8000)

### How to use parameters

Each of the previous parameters can be directly passed to the CLI by using either `--<option-name> <value>`, or by
utilising the equivalent environment variable. The equivalent environment variable of any option will be named
`FLAMA_<OPTION_NAME>=<VALUE>` (take care, the equivalent environment variable needs to have the prefix **FLAMA**, and
written in capital letters, and underscored). For instance, if we want to change the route where the model is served we
can do it by any of the following two equivalent ways:

#### Using option argument

```console
flama serve sklearn_model.flm --model-url=/xor
```

#### Using environment variable

```console
export FLAMA_MODEL_PATH=sklearn_model.flm
export FLAMA_MODEL_URL=/xor
flama serve sklearn_model.flm
```

## Example

As a quick usage example which populates all application and models parameters, we can run the following command line:

```console
flama serve sklearn_model.flm \
    --model-url="/xor" \
    --model-name="XOR dummy model" \
    --app-debug \
    --app-title="ML API" \
    --app-version="1.0.0" \
    --app-description="XOR model serving for predictions" \
    --app-docs="/docs/" \
    --app-schema="/schema/"
```

With these changes, the documentation at **http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs/** will look like:
