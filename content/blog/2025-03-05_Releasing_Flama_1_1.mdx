# Releasing Flama 1.10

Spring has sprung, and with it comes a fresh new release of Flama! We‚Äôre
thrilled to announce
[Flama 1.10](https://github.com/vortico/flama/releases/tag/v1.10.0/) üéâ,
packed with exciting features that have been brewing since our last major
update. This release rolls up the goodness from 1.8 and 1.9, which we didn‚Äôt
get around to shouting about earlier, and tops it off with some shiny new
additions in 1.10. Let‚Äôs dive into the highlights!

This release brings a slew of new capabilities to make your ML API development
smoother, smarter, and more powerful. Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs new across these versions:

- Access and Refresh Token Components (1.8.0): Say hello to enhanced security
  and flexibility! Flama now includes components for access and refresh tokens,
  making it easier to implement robust authentication flows and manage user
  sessions seamlessly.

- Support for Python 3.13 and Dropping 3.8 (1.8.0): We‚Äôre keeping up with the
  times‚ÄîFlama now supports Python 3.13, bringing you the latest language
  features and performance boosts. To keep things lean, we‚Äôve waved goodbye to
  Python 3.8 compatibility.

- Adapted Serialization for New TensorFlow Version (1.8.0): Machine learning
  devs, rejoice! Flama‚Äôs serialization has been updated to play nicely with the
  latest TensorFlow version, ensuring your models integrate effortlessly.

- Typing.Annotated for Schema Types (1.9.0): We‚Äôve leveled up our type system
  by adopting typing.Annotated for schema definitions. This makes your code more
  expressive and type-safe, giving you clearer control over your API schemas.

- Allow Importing DDD Without SQLAlchemy Installed (1.9.0): Flexibility is
  key! You can now use Flama‚Äôs ddd module without needing SQLAlchemy, making
  it lighter and more adaptable to your project‚Äôs needs.

- Compatibility Lib for Older Python Versions (1.9.0): While we‚Äôve embraced
  the future with 3.13, we‚Äôve also added a compatibility library to ensure
  smooth sailing on older Python versions where needed.

- Path Params Component (1.10.0): Dynamic routing just got better! The new
  path parameters component lets you handle URL variables with ease, giving your
  APIs more versatility.

- Replace Black and Isort with Ruff (1.10.0): We‚Äôve swapped out Black and
  Isort for Ruff, a faster and more comprehensive tool for code formatting and
  linting. Your development workflow just got a speed boost!

- Replace Poetry with UV (1.10.0): Dependency management is now powered by UV
  instead of Poetry, offering a snappier and more efficient way to handle your
  project‚Äôs packages.

- Module for Gathering Telemetry Data (1.10.0): Get insights like never
  before! Flama now includes a telemetry module to help you track usage and
  performance, empowering data-driven decisions for your APIs.

- Enrich OpenAPI Specification (1.10.0): Your API docs are about to get a
  glow-up. We‚Äôve enriched the OpenAPI spec generation, making it more
  detailed and user-friendly for consumers of your APIs.

- Docs Page Using Scalar (1.10.0): Speaking of docs, we‚Äôve introduced a
  sleek new documentation page powered by Scalar. It‚Äôs prettier, more
  interactive, and makes exploring Flama‚Äôs features a breeze.

To help you make the most of these updates, we‚Äôll be rolling out a few
detailed follow-up posts with examples showcasing how to leverage telemetry,
path params, and the enriched OpenAPI specs in your projects. Keep an eye out!

Stay tuned for more, and happy coding! üöÄ
